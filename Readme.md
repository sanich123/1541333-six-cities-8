This project was written when I studied at https://htmlacademy.ru/

I used React, React-Router, Redux, TypeScript.

The application has three pages: a catalog of points, a separate page, a page of favorite points.

An application has following functionality:

1. There is an authentication here. 
2. If you want to add a city into your favorite list, you have to be authenticated.
3. When you are authenticated, you are able to add comments.
4. You need to be authenticated to follow favorites page, if you aren't, you will be redirected to authentication page.

If you want to, you can:

clone this project ('git clone [name of repository]'),
navigate into project's folder ('cd [folder's name]')
install dependencies ('npm i'),
and run the project with 'npm run start' script.
